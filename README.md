# Example workflow updating Dependabot pull requests

Starting **March 1st, 2021** workflows triggered by [Dependabot PRs will run with read-only permissions](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-19-github-actions-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-prs-will-run-with-read-only-permissions/).

This repository is running an example Actions workflow to update dependabot pull requests without direct read-write/secrets access.

## Workflows

The `Build Dependabot Bundler PR` workflow runs on all pushes to `dependabot/bundler**` branches with a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This action gets triggered when Dependabot opens new pull requests or force-pushes updates to existing pull requests.

This action will run a `bundle install` without write access to the repository as this can execute potentially unsafe third-party ruby code when installing
git dependencies.

The completion of this workflow triggers the `Update Dependabot Bundler PR` workflow which has a read-write `GITHUB_TOKEN`, extracting the changes to license files and pushing these to back to the Dependabot PR branch.
