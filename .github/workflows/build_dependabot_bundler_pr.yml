# This workflow runs with a READ-ONLY GITHUB_TOKEN
# https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-19-github-actions-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-prs-will-run-with-read-only-permissions/

# This action will run a `bundle install` without write access to the repository
# as this can execute potentially unsafe third-party ruby code when installing
# git dependencies.

# The completion of this workflow triggers the `Update Dependabot Bundler PR`
# workflow which has a read-write GITHUB_TOKEN, extracting the changes to
# license files and pushing these to back to the Dependabot PR branch.
